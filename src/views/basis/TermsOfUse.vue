				<h2>Terms of Use</h2>
				<span>PLEASE NOTE: THE SECTION OF THESE TERMS OF USE ENTITLED “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” CONTAINS AN
					ARBITRATION CLAUSE THAT REQUIRES DISPUTES TO BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND PROHIBITS
					CLASS ACTION CLAIMS. IT AFFECTS HOW DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND iSHARE ARE RESOLVED. BY ACCEPTING THESE
					TERMS OF USE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.</span>
				<span>PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES (DEFINED BELOW) ARE SUBJECT TO THE
					FOLLOWING TERMS; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES
					IN ANY MANNER.</span>
				<p>Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products,
					services and applications(the "Services"). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns
					regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at support@isharelike.com</p>
				<h3>Will these Terms ever change?</h3>
				<p>We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the
					Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to
					your attention by placing a notice on the Services, by sending you an email, and/or by some other
					means. If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means
					you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to
					the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p>
				<p>Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be
					effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.</p>
				<h3>What about my privacy?</h3>
				<p>iSHARE takes the privacy of its users very seriously. For the current iSHARE Privacy Policy, please
					visit Privacy Policy.</p>
				<p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain
					parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from
					children who are under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable
					information from children under 13; if you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to register
					for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. Parents and legal guardians
					may not agree to these Terms or register for the Services on behalf of any children under the age of
					13. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that
					information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us
					personal information, please contact us at support@isharelike.com</p>
				<h3>What are the basics of using the Services?</h3>
				<p>You may be required to sign up for an account, and select a password and user name (“iSHARE User
					ID”). You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about
					yourself. You may not select as your iSHARE User ID a name that you don’t have the right to use, or
					another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account
					to anyone else without our prior written permission.</p>
				<P>You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a binding contract (or if
					not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and gotten your
					parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf)</P>
				<p>You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal, use, and not on behalf of or for the
					benefit of any third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If
					your use of the Services is prohibited by any applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the
					Services. We can’t and won’t be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the
					law.</p>
				<p>You will not share your account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your
					account and your password. You’re responsible for any activity associated with your account.</p>
				<p>You may have multiple accounts on iSHARE but iSHARE strictly forbids the use of multiple accounts for
					the same sole user or the use of one account for multiple users for the purpose of earning more
					rewards. iSHARE will not honor rewards earned from such accounts.</p>
				<p>By using the Services, you will automatically be deemed to have opted in to receive e-mail
					communication from us. When you sign in for the first time, your preferences will be set to
					automatically publish all social interactions to other social networks. However, you will be able to
					edit these preferences at any time under “Settings.”</p>
				<h4>Your use of the Services is subject to the following additional restrictions:</h4>
				<p>You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not contribute any Content or User Submission (each
					of those terms is defined below) or otherwise use the Services or interact with the Services in a
					manner that:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of anyone else
						(including iSHARE);</li>
					<li>Violates any law or regulation, including any applicable export control laws;</li>
					<li>Is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise
						objectionable;</li>
					<li>Jeopardizes the security of your iSHARE account or anyone else’s (such as allowing someone else
						to log in to the Services as you);</li>
					<li>Attempts, in any manner, to obtain the password, account, or other security information from any
						other user;</li>
					<li>Violates the security of any computer network, or cracks any passwords or security encryption
						codes;</li>
					<li>Runs Maillist, Listserv, any form of auto-responder or “spam” on the Services, or any processes
						that run or are activated while you are not logged into the Services, or that otherwise
						interfere with the proper working of the Services (including by placing an unreasonable load on
						the Services’ infrastructure);</li>
					<li>“Crawls,” “scrapes,” or “spiders” any page, data, or portion of or relating to the Services or
						Content (through use of manual or automated means);</li>
					<li>Copies or stores any significant portion of the Content;</li>
					<li>Decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code or underlying
						ideas or information of or relating to the Services; or</li>
					<li>Upload, transmit, distribute, store, create, or otherwise sell or offer for sale any Prohibited
						Items.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the
					Services.</p>
				<h3>What are my rights in the Services?</h3>
				<p>The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but not
					limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions, and so
					forth (all of the foregoing, the “Content”) are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual
					property laws. You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and
					restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy,
					reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display,
					license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the
					prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including
					iSHARE’s) rights.</p>
				<p>You understand that iSHARE owns the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the
					transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative
					works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.</p>
				<p>The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because
					this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply – they do!</p>
				<h3>Do I have to grant any licenses to iSHARE or to other users?</h3>
				<p>Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your “User
					Submission.” Some User Submissions are viewable by other users. In order to display your User
					Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us
					certain rights in those User Submissions. Please note that all of the following licenses are subject
					to our Privacy Policy to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your
					personally-identifiable information.</p>
				<p>For all User Submissions, you hereby grant iSHARE a license to translate, modify (for technical
					purposes, for example making sure your content is viewable on an iPhone as well as a computer) and
					reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in each case to enable us to
					operate the Services, as described in more detail below. This is a license only – your ownership in
					User Submissions is not affected.</p>
				<p>If you store a User Submission in your own personal iSHARE account, in a manner that is not viewable
					by any other user except you (a “Personal User Submission”), you grant iSHARE the license above, as
					well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User Submission for the sole
					purpose of making that Personal User Submission accessible to you and providing the Services
					necessary to do so.</p>
				<p>If you share a User Submission only in a manner that only certain specified users can view (for
					example, a private message to one or more other users)(a “Limited Audience User Submission”), then
					you grant iSHARE the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your
					Limited Audience User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Limited Audience User
					Submission accessible to such other specified users, and providing the Services necessary to do so.
					Also, you grant such other specified users a license to access that Limited Audience User
					Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the
					Services.</p>
				<p>If you share a User Submission publicly on the Services and/or in a manner that more than just you or
					certain specified users can view, or if you provide us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any
					feedback, suggestions, improvements, enhancements, and/or feature requests relating to the Services
					(each of the foregoing, a “Public User Submission”), then you grant iSHARE the licenses above, as
					well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Public User Submission for the purpose of
					making that Public User Submission accessible to all iSHARE users and providing the Services
					necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that
					Public User Submission in connection with the Services and/or otherwise in connection with iSHARE’s
					business, provided that iSHARE will try to notify you if it uses your Public User Submission for any
					reason other than displaying it on the Services. Also, you grant all other users of the Services a
					license to access that Public User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as
					permitted by the functionality of the Services.</p>
				<p>You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual, sublicenseable, irrevocable, and
					worldwide.</p>
				<p>Finally, you understand and agree that iSHARE, in performing the required technical steps to provide
					the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to
					conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection networks,
					devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses include the rights to do so.</p>
				<h3>What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?</h3>
				<p>You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), as it relates to online
					service providers, like iSHARE, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone’s
					copyright. We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or
					disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged
					infringers; to review our complete Copyright Dispute Policy and learn how to report potentially
					infringing content, see here. To learn more about the DMCA, see here.</p>
				<h3>Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?</h3>
				<p>Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole
					responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information
					and content at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information
					or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and
					have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions
					you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all
					liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. We can’t guarantee
					the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for
					which users gain access to the Services.</p>
				<p>You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent
					and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You
					will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for all your
					activity in connection with the Services.</p>
				<p>The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned
					or controlled by iSHARE. When you access third party websites or use third party services, you
					accept that there are risks in doing so, and that iSHARE is not responsible for such risks. We
					encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and
					privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize.</p>
				<p>iSHARE has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy
					policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party
					that you interact with through the Services. In addition, iSHARE will not and cannot monitor,
					verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site or service. By using the Services, you
					release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party
					website or service.</p>
				<p>Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including
					payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or
					representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or
					individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before
					proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that
					iSHARE shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result
					of any such dealings. In particular, and without limiting the foregoing, you agree that iSHARE does
					not facilitate (and bears no responsibility or liability for) any transaction (or payment or refund
					therefore) arranged through iSHARE Local.</p>
				<p>If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you
					agree that iSHARE is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute
					with one or more other users, you release iSHARE, its officers, employees, agents, and successors
					from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or
					unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or
					our Services.</p>
				<p>YOU SHALL AND HEREBY DO WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH SAYS: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES
					NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE
					TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR
					HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."</p>
				<h3>Will iSHARE ever change the Services?</h3>
				<p>We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or
					discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain
					features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we
					make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always
					practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for
					any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in
					violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.</p>
				<h3>Do the Services cost anything?</h3>
				<p>It is currently free to access and browse iSHARE or any other Services. However, you may choose to
					purchase products through the Services, and you alone will be responsible for paying the purchase
					price of any products you buy, in addition to any taxes and shipping costs. iSHARE may limit or
					cancel quantities of products purchased, and it reserves the right to refuse any order. In the event
					iSHARE needs to make a change to an order, it will attempt to notify you by contacting the email
					address, billing address, and/or phone number provided at the time the order was made. Prices are
					subject to change at any time. Due to separate and applicable tax jurisdictions, your purchases may
					be subject to specific sales, custom or value-added taxes, and the shipping time and associated cost
					may increase accordingly.</p>
				<p>iSHARE reserves the right to require payment of fees for certain or all Services, in addition to the
					fees charged for the purchase of products. You shall pay all such fees, as described on the website
					in connection with such Services selected by you. iSHARE reserves the right to change its price list
					and to institute new charges at any time, upon notice to you, which may be sent by email or posted
					on the Website. Your use of the Services following such notification constitutes your acceptance of
					any new or increased charges.</p>
				<h3>Prices</h3>
				<p>Prices are set by the third-party merchants offering these items for sale, and not by iSHARE. The
					merchants also provide all information in the item listings, including any strike-through prices.
					iSHARE does not represent, warrant, or guarantee that the merchant actually offered or sold the item
					at the strike-through price.</p>
				<h3>What if I need to return a purchase?</h3>
				<p>We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase on the Services. If for any reason you are
					unhappy, please contact iSHARE support at support@isharelike.com.</p>
				<p>You may return all products within 30 days of delivery. You can initiate a return or a refund on
					items from your Order History page. Simply click on ‘Contact Support’ next to the item you iSHARE to
					request a return or a refund and iSHARE Support will be ready to assist.</p>
				<p>We aim to process all requests within 72 hours upon receiving. Refunds are issued back to the
					original form of payment used to purchase the order. Should you have any questions about the status
					of your refund, your return or your account, please feel free to contact iSHARE support at
					support@isharelike.com. For more information on our Return Policy, visit Return Policy.</p>
				<p>If a iSHARE promotional credit is applied to an order and that order is refunded for any reason, any
					promotional credit used in that order will not be refunded.</p>
				<p>iSHARE cannot refund, reimburse, cover, or otherwise be responsible for any fees not paid to iSHARE.
					This includes any customs taxes or VAT as well as any return shipping costs you may incur in the
					refund process.</p>
				<p>However, the foregoing refund and return terms DO NOT apply to any product you purchase by using
					iSHARE Local. Transactions conducted by using iSHARE Local are entirely between you and the other
					user of iSHARE Local.</p>
				<h3>What if I want to receive iSHARE mobile text alerts or opt-out?</h3>
				<p>If you would like to enroll to receive mobile texts and alerts about iSHARE products and services,
					you may sign up to do so on the checkout page for purchasing a product through iSHARE by providing
					your consent to receive recurring autodialed marketing texts from or on behalf of us at the mobile
					number you’ve provided to opt-in. You understand that consent is not a condition of purchase.
					Message and data rates may apply. If you would like to be removed from the iSHARE text list, you can
					follow the instructions provided in those messages or otherwise reply STOP to any iSHARE alert. If
					you have any questions, you may reply HELP to any iSHARE alert or contact customer care at
					support@isharelike.com.</p>
				<h3>What if I want to stop using the Services?</h3>
				<p>You’re free to do that at any time, by following the steps at Help/FAQ. Please refer to our Privacy
					Policy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us
					after you have stopped using our Services. iSHARE is also free to terminate (or suspend access to)
					your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of
					these Terms. iSHARE has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the
					restrictions set forth in these Terms.</p>
				<p>Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep
					that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.</p>
				<p>Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive
					termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you
					have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or
					intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.</p>
				<h3>What else do I need to know?</h3>
				<h5>Warranty Disclaimer</h5>
				<p>Neither iSHARE nor its licensors or suppliers makes any representations or warranties concerning any
					content contained in or accessed through the Services, and we will not be responsible or liable for
					the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed
					through the Services. We(and our licensors and suppliers) make no representations or warranties
					regarding suggestions or recommendations of services or products offered or purchased through the
					Services. Products and services purchased or offered(whether or not following such recommendations
					and suggestions) through the Services are provided “AS IS” and without any warranty of any kind from
					iSHARE or others(unless, with respect to such others only, provided expressly and unambiguously in
					writing by a designated third party for a specific product). THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED
					BY iSHARE(AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS) ON AN “AS-IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR ANY KIND,
					EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
					FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE
					UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY
					LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
				<h5>Limitation of Liability</h5>
				<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY
					(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL iSHARE (OR ITS
					LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
					INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF
					GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR (B) ANY AMOUNT,
					IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) $100 OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO iSHARE IN
					CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM, OR
					(III) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION
					OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
				<h5>Indemnity</h5>
				<p>To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, You agree to indemnify and hold iSHARE, its
					affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and partners harmless from and against any and all claims,
					liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees)
					arising from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to (a) your use of the
					Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation
					of these Terms. In the event of such a claim, suit, or action (“Claim”), we will attempt to provide
					notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to
					deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).</p>
				<h5>Assignment</h5>
				<p>You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your
					Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without iSHARE’s prior written
					consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without
					consent.</p>
				<h5>Choice Of Law & Jurisdiction.</h5>
				<p>These Terms and your use of the Services will be interpreted in accordance with the law of the State
					of California and the United States of America, without regard to their conflict-of-law provisions.
					You and iSHARE agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in San
					Francisco County, San Francisco, California or a United States District court, Northern District of
					California located in San Francisco, California (collectively, the “San Francisco Courts”) for any
					actions which the parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court
					of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or
					violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual
					property rights, as set forth in the Dispute Resolution provision below.</p>
				<h5>Miscellaneous</h5>
				<p>You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other
					governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided
					that the iSHARE may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as
					it sees fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be
					deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be
					unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent
					necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You
					and iSHARE agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual
					understanding between you and iSHARE, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and
					oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these
					Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint
					venture of iSHARE, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind iSHARE in any respect
					whatsoever. Except as expressly set forth in the section above regarding the Apple Applications, you
					and iSHARE agree there are no third party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.</p>
				<h5>Dispute Resolution</h5>
				<h5>Mandatory, Bilateral Arbitration and Waiver of Class Actions.</h5>
				<h5>Please read this carefully. It affects your rights. YOU AND iSHARE AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE,
					CONTROVERSY, OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF iSHARE, TO ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES
					SOLD OR DISTRIBUTED BY OR THROUGH iSHARE, TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR TO THE CONTENT, AND/OR USER
					SUBMISSION (PUBLIC, PERSONAL AND/OR LIMITED AUDIENCE) ON iSHARE SHALL BE RESOLVED ONLY BY FINAL AND
					BINDING, BILATERAL ARBITRATION, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your
					claims qualify; and (2) this agreement to arbitrate does not include your or iSHARE’s right to seek
					injunctive or other equitable relief in state or federal court in San Francisco to prevent the
					actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights,
					trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. The Federal Arbitration
					Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement and govern all
					questions as to whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.</h5>
				<h5>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. An
					arbitrator, however, can award on individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including
					injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms of
					Use.</h5>
				<p>“Disputes” shall include, but are not limited to, any claims or controversies between you and iSHARE
					against each other related in any way to or arising out of in any way from the Service, the Content,
					User Submission (Public, Personal, and/or Limited Audience), including but not limited to sales,
					returns, refunds, cancellations, defects, policies, privacy, advertising, or any communications
					between you and iSHARE, even if the claim arises after you or iSHARE has terminated Service or a
					user account. Disputes also include, but are not limited to, claims that: (a) you bring against our
					employees, agents, affiliates, or other representatives; or (b) that iSHARE brings against you.
					Disputes also include, but are not limited to, (i) claims in any way related to or arising out of
					any aspect of the relationship between you and iSHARE, whether based in contract, tort, statute,
					fraud, misrepresentation, advertising claims, or any other legal theory; (ii) claims that arose
					before these Terms or out of a prior set of Terms with iSHARE; (iii) claims that are subject to
					on-going litigation where you are not a party or a class member; and/or (iv) claims that arise after
					the termination of these Terms.</p>
				<h5>Dispute Notice</h5>
				<p>Before initiating an arbitration, you and iSHARE each agree to first provide the other a written
					notice (“Notice of Dispute”), which shall contain: (a) a written description of the problem and
					relevant documents and supporting information; and (b) a statement of the specific relief sought. A
					Notice of Dispute should be sent to: One Sansome Street, San Francisco, CA 94104 or emailed at
					support@isharelike.com. iSHARE will provide a Notice of Dispute to you via the email address
					associated with your iSHARE User ID. You and iSHARE agree to make attempts to resolve the Dispute
					prior to commencing an arbitration and not to commence an arbitration proceeding until this 45-day
					post-notice resolution period expires. If an agreement cannot be reached within forty-five (45) days
					of receipt of the Notice of Dispute, you or iSHARE may commence an arbitration proceeding.</p>
				<h5>Arbitration Process and Procedure</h5>
				<p>Unless you and iSHARE agree otherwise in writing, arbitration shall (1) be administered by the
					Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined
					Arbitration Rules & Procedures then in effect (the “JAMS Rules”) and as modified by this agreement
					to arbitrate, including the rules regarding filing, administration, discovery, and arbitrator fees;
					(2) be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator; and (3) take place in the county where you reside.
					To the extent that this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with the JAMS Policy on Consumer
					Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards for Procedural Fairness (the “Minimum
					Standards”), the Minimum Standards in that regard will apply.</p>
				<p>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis
					and not in a class or representative action. Further, unless both you and iSHARE expressly agree
					otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims. If this prohibition of
					class, representative, or consolidated arbitration is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety
					of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. If, for any reason, a claim proceeds in court
					rather than in arbitration, we each waive our right to a jury trial.</p>
				<p>If, for any reason, a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive our right to
					a jury trial.</p>
				<h5>YOU THEREFORE UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND iSHARE ARE EACH
					WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION FOR ANY CLAIMS
					COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT.</h5>
				<p>The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party
					seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's
					individual claim.</p>
				<p>The JAMS Rules are available on its website at
					https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/. Notwithstanding any JAMS Rules to the
					contrary or any other provision in the arbitration rules chosen, by agreement, to govern, you and
					iSHARE each agree that all issues regarding the Dispute are delegated to the arbitrator to decide,
					except that only a court(and not the arbitrator) shall decide any disagreements regarding the scope
					and enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate.</p>
				<h5>Hearing</h5>
				<p>If your claim does not exceed $5,000, you and iSHARE agree to waive an oral hearing by the arbitrator
					and the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and iSHARE submit to the
					arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
					To the extent an oral hearing is requested by you or iSHARE, or deemed necessary by the arbitrator,
					you and iSHARE agree that the hearing will be conducted telephonically or videographically.</p>
				<h5>Arbitrator's Decision</h5>
				<p>An arbitrator’s award will be a written statement of the disposition of each claim and will also
					provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions which form the basis
					of the award. The arbitrator’s decision and award is final and binding, with some limited court
					review under the FAA, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent
					jurisdiction.</p>
				<h5>Fees</h5>
				<p>It is each parties’ responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, case management/administrative, and
					arbitrator fees as set forth in the JAMS Rules. If your claim for damages does not exceed $5,000,
					iSHARE will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Dispute
					or the relief sought was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the
					standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
				<h5>Small Claims & Government Actions</h5>
				<p>As an alternative to arbitration, you or iSHARE may resolve Disputes in a small claims court that has
					jurisdiction over your claim. These Terms and this arbitration agreement do not prevent you from
					bringing your Dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agency. Such
					agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against iSHARE on your behalf.</p>
