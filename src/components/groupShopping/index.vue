				<p><span>1</span>What’s Group Shopping?</p>
				<em>Group Shopping is a kind of group buying and you can enjoy buying products at significantly reduced prices on the condition that a specified number of buyers would make the purchase.</em>
				<p><span>2</span>What’s the condition for new buyers to enjoy their exclusive?</p>
				<em>Users who have no orders after registration must activate the account before enjoying the newcomer exclusive.</em>
				<p><span>3</span>Does Coupon can be used for Group Shopping orders?</p>
				<em>No, coupon and social saving price cannot be enjoyed at the same time.</em>
				<p><span>4</span>How long does a Group Shopping last?</p>
				<em>Each saving group lasts 24 hours. If the validity of an item's Group Shopping activity is less than 24 hours, the valid time should be subjected to the validity of item activity.</em>
				<p><span>5</span>Can I cancel a Group Shopping order?</p>
				<em>No, there is no manual way to cancel a Group Shopping order. But don't worry, if there are not enough buyers within a group, the order will be voided and refunded.</em>
				<p><span>6</span>How can I make sure a Group Shopping deal is successful?</p>
				<em>If necessary number of people has been invited and the payment has been finished in the set time, the group will succeed.</em>
				<p><span>7</span>What are the reasons for a failure Group Shopping?</p>
				<em>A. If the number of saving group members does not reach its goal in the validity of 24 hours, the group will fail.</em>
				<em>B. If the item has been sold out before group members assemble successfully in the validity of 24 hours, the group will fail.</em>
				<em>C. If a participant of a saving group doesn’t finish his or her payment in 30 minutes, the system will automatically cancel the order and other group participants can continue to join in.</em>
				<p><span>8</span>How to refund?</p>
				<em>If a Social Saving group fails, the system will process the refund within 1-10 working days after the expiration of the group, and the refund will return to your original payment account.</em>
